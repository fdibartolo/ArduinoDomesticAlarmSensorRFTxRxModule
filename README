This is the RF & TX transmitter sensor module that it operates at its own, serving as a wireless sensor access point. This runs on a Arduino Nano with ATMega168 microcontroller.

This module will be polling over its own wired sensors (PIR and magnetic), and when any are triggered, will notify the central unit through a RF transmitter.
